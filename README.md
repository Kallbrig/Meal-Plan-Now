# Meal-Plan-Now
Android meal viewer application built for my CS-3332 - Software Engineering course.

Google Firebase, Firestore, the Anko library, and TheMealDB API were all used heavily.

This was a 4 person group project that I did entirely on my own.

# What I Learned

* This project was my introduction to Kotlin, which the entire project is written in.
* Developed a user interface within a xml file using android UI components such as ScrollView, ListView, EditText, Button, etc.
* learned to parse and work with Json using gson as well as the built-in Json parser in Android.
* Introduction to Threads and Threading on Android. This was my largest hurdle. 
 This was my first contact with AsyncTasks, & Coroutines for network calls and background work.
* The Anko library was used for AsyncTasks. This was later partially replaced by coroutines.
* Authentication was implemented using Firebase. Users can sign in with Email and Password.
* Attempted to implement Firestore for database integration. This was a hurdle that I was overcoming when the class came to and end.
* This project taught me the fundamentals of Git and Github.

# My thoughts
This project taught me more than any other development project that I've ever attempted. This was intended to be a 4 person project, but i ended up writing 100% of the code. After the class ended, I became burnt out and put the project on hold. Even partially completed, I'm very proud of what I accomplished on this. On another note, this project taught me how much there still is out there to learn.
